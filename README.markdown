# Gibber #
Gibber is a live coding environment for the web browser, combining music synthesis and sequencing with ray-marching 3d graphics.

## Playgrounds ##
- [Version 1](https://gibber.cc)
- [Version 2 (alpha status, but try it!)](https://gibber.cc/alpha/playground/)

## Building Gibber ##
There are three main components this repo wraps, in addition to providing the editing interface.

1. [gibber.audio.lib](https://github.com/charlieroberts/gibber.audio.lib)
2. [gibber.graphics.lib](https://github.com/charlieroberts/gibber.graphics.lib)
3. [gibber.core.lib](https://github.com/charlieroberts/gibber.core.lib)

Assuming you have node/npm installed, you can run `npm i` in the top level of this repo to get all the required modules and build the editor; you can also build the library / editor by calling `npx gulp` (or `npx gulp watch` to run a continuous build). This creates the file `playground/bundle.js` that is included in a script tag inside the playground's `index.html` page.

Gibber loads an audio worklet that is currently assumed to be at `node_modules/gibberish-dsp/dist/gibberish_worklet.js`. If your node installation places that worklet somewhere else you can edit the location in the `environment.js` file and then run gulp again... just do a search for `gibberish_worklet` to find the relevant section of the code.

Finally, `npm start` will create a server running on port 8080. To view gibber in your browser, visit `127.0.0.1:8080`.
